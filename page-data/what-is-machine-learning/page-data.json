But it is only the awesomeness of this technical field is to be blamed.</p>\n<p>Ever since its conception half a decade ago, A.I has extensively transformed the face of computer science, rapidly expanding the limit of\nwhat these machines can do.\nMachine learning systems are capable of processing massive data and perform tasks with accuracy comparable to human. </p>\n<p>With the introduction of <strong>Deep learning</strong> around the beginning of the century along with the increasingly availability of data and computing power,\nMachine learning models can now generate, predict, perform humanlike tasks, such as <strong>entity recognition in images</strong>,\n<strong>chatbots which can converse with people so naturally that some almost passed the Turing test</strong> or <strong>lifelike video generator (yes i am talking about Deepfake)</strong>.</p>\n<p>But Machine Learning isn't some kind of elite tech. For long, companies have started providing Machine Learning services for laypeople, which are really easy to\nuse and incorporate into their products. The thing is, people don't really understand how those services work, and for most of the time they don't really need to,\nbut you can't make best use of those techs without knowing them inside out. </p>\n<p>That's why AI engineers are paid so fucking much, it is a demanding and high qualified job. Most importantly, AI is deeply rooted in <strong><em>Math</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's a Computer Science field with papers filled with metric tons of Math symbols.</p>\n<p>But you know what they say, you can't have life handed to you. If you want to earn figures, start getting your asses comfortable with Math. I am doing that too, really.</p>\n<p>This blog will track my progress as I learn AI stuffs (and also English writing, I suck at it). Keep in mind that by the time I am writing these lines I am still a student.</p>\n<p>But I am ambitious and determined to get that figures. I will learn if I have to, you'll see.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"2020-05-25T02:50:54.615Z","title":"An Introduction to Machine learning and me.","keyword":["machine_learning","blog"],"description":"What the hell is ML, really?"},"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-machine-learning/"},"tableOfContents":""}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"series":{"slug":"machine-learning","description":"This is a series about Machine Learning","posts":[{"frontmatter":{"title":"An Introduction to Machine learning and me.","date":"2020-05-25T02:50:54.615Z","description":"What the hell is ML, really?","keyword":["machine_learning","blog"],"series":"Machine learning"},"fields":{"slug":"/what-is-machine-learning/","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}],"name":"Machine learning"}}}}
